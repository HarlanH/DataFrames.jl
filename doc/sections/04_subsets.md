# Accessing and Modifying Entries of DataArray and DataFrame Objects

The `DataArray` type is meant to behave like a standard Julia `Array` and tries to implement identical indexing rules:

	dv = DataArray([1, 2, 3])
	dv[1]
	dv[2] = NA
	dv[2]

	dm = DataArray([1 2; 3 4])
	dm[1, 1]
	dm[2, 1] = NA
	dm[2, 1]

In contrast, a `DataFrame` offers substantially more forms of indexing because columns can be referred to by name:

	df = DataFrame(A = 1:10, B = 2:2:20)

	df[1]
	df["A"]

	df[1, 1]
	df[1, "A"]

	df[1:3, ["A", "B"]]
	df[1:3, ["B", "A"]]

	df[df["A"] % 2 .== 0, :]
	df[df["B"] % 2 .== 0, :]

To simplify the last example (in which we examined the properties of column of `df` to determine which rows to return), you can also index rows using quoted expressions that will be evaluated using the columns of the `DataFrame`:

	df[:(A % 2 .== 0), :]

Expression indexing makes it easier to build up complex subsets:

	df[:((A % 2 .== 0) & (B % 4 .== 0)), :]

This kind of indexing can also be accomplished using `select`:

	select(:((A % 2 .== 0) & (B % 4 .== 0)), df)
