For more illustrations of DataFrames.jl usage, in particular in conjunction with
other packages you can check-out the following resources
(they are kept up to date with the released version of DataFrames.jl):
* [Data Wrangling with DataFrames.jl Cheat Sheet](https://www.ahsmart.com/pub/data-wrangling-with-data-frames-jl-cheat-sheet/)
* [DataFrames Tutorial using Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial/)
* [Julia Academy DataFrames.jl tutorial](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/DataFrames)
* [JuliaCon 2019](https://github.com/bkamins/JuliaCon2019-DataFrames-Tutorial), [JuliaCon 2020](https://github.com/bkamins/JuliaCon2020-DataFrames-Tutorial), and [PyData Global 2020](https://github.com/bkamins/PyDataGlobal2020) tutorials
* [DataFrames.jl showcase](https://github.com/bkamins/DataFrames-Showcase)

Below is a list of curated user-supplied codes.

* TBD how to best maintain it; I think we should keep these snippets in DataFrames.jl repository as separate markdown pages
* I would split them into: tutorials (probably longer) and how-to guides

If you would like to contribute to this list please opan a Pull Request with a proposed change.
