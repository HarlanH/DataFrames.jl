DataFrames.jl Overview
========================================

The DataFrames package provides the essential tools you need for working with statistical data in Julia.

In particular, DataFrames provides:

- NA: A new Julia type that represents a missing value
- DataArray: A new Julia type that emulates Juliaâ€™s standard Array type, but adds the ability to store missing values in the array
- DataFrame: A new Julia type that represents tabular datasets like those found in typical databases or spreadsheets
